# Report on Research Progress

**Ph.D. Student:** Decory Edwards
**Main Advisor:** Chris Carroll
**Work Completed in (month/year):** March 2024
**Date Filed:** March 27, 2024

1. Please list meetings (frequency, forum, etc.) with your main advisor.
* We meet every Friday at 4pm with some exceptions.

2. Please list meetings with other faculty and/or advisors.

* For now, my only meetings are with my main advisor, Chris. My second advisor is now Professor Wright but we meet infrequently.

3. For my job market paper, 

I planned (last month) to accomplish the following:
* Compare two versions of my code to figure out the discrepancy in the newer version.
* Implement bequests with calibration of values using literature
* Revise the structural estimation procedure so that the bequest parameter is estimated as well
* Implement heterogeneity in risky returns (instead of heterogeneity in a risky asset)

For my job market paper, I accomplished the following:
* In the two months that have passed, I have resolved the bugs in the code. At this point, I have put on hold the final extensions of the model (structural estimation of bequest parameter and incorporating the choice of a risky asset) until after the CEF conference in mid-June. That said, I have a clear path ahead on what tasks should be completed to round out my job market paper. 

Supposing there are discrepancies between a and b, explain why.

For my job market paper, I plan to accomplish the following next month:
* Implement bequests with calibration of values using literature
* Revise the structural estimation procedure so that the bequest parameter is estimated as well
* Implement heterogeneity in risky returns (instead of heterogeneity in a risky asset)
    

4. What other papers are you working on? With whom?

* I am currently reading and trying to come up with a topic to co-author with a classmate, Kyung. This has hit a dead end, for whatever reason. I am anxious about finding a coauthor for the second chapter. But perhaps it will be single-authored. This seems like the tougher option and it would be best to find someone to coauthor with, even if I am the second author.

5. For each paper listed in 4, please answer the questions in 3?
