# Report on Research Progress

**Ph.D. Student:** Decory Edwards
**Main Advisor:** Chris Carroll
**Work Completed in (month/year):** November 2023 - February 2024
**Date Filed:** March 16, 2024

1. Please list meetings (frequency, forum, etc.) with your main advisor.
* We meet every Friday at 4pm with some exceptions.

2. Please list meetings with other faculty and/or advisors.

* For now, my only meetings are with my main advisor, Chris. My second advisor is now Professor Wright but we meet infrequently.

3. For my job market paper, 

I planned (last month) to accomplish the following:
* “Code up” the life-cycle version of the model and compare the solution there to the solution to the baseline model. 
* Extensively go through the JEDC volume and provide citations from each of the (eight) papers there regarding the calibration methods used in those models. In particular, I want to be very clear on where each of these values come from. Some are more straightforward than others; in particular, I want to be sure where the capital-to-output ratio comes from. In my first reading of the volume, I could not find it anywhere.

For my job market paper, I accomplished the following:
* I would say that I accomplished the first and not the second. The latter is a minor task that still needs to be completed.

Supposing there are discrepancies between a and b, explain why.

For my job market paper, I plan to accomplish the following next month:
* Compare two versions of my code to figure out the discrepancy in the newer version.
* Implement bequests with calibration of values using literature
* Revise the structural estimation procedure so that the bequest parameter is estimated as well
* Implement heterogeneity in risky returns (instead of heterogeneity in a risky asset)

    

4. What other papers are you working on? With whom?
* I am currently reading and trying to come up with a topic to co-author with a classmate, Kyung. I also have some budding ideas on the other two chapters of my dissertation, but for now, the tasks listed above are of higher priority. 

5. For each paper listed in 4, please answer the questions in 3?
