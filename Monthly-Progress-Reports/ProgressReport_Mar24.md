# Report on Research Progress

**Ph.D. Student:** Decory Edwards
**Main Advisor:** Chris Carroll
**Work Completed in (month/year):** March 2024
**Date Filed:** March 27, 2024

1. Please list meetings (frequency, forum, etc.) with your main advisor.
* We meet every Friday at 4pm with some exceptions.

2. Please list meetings with other faculty and/or advisors.

* For now, my only meetings are with my main advisor, Chris. My second advisor is now Professor Wright but we meet infrequently.

3. For my job market paper, 

I planned (last month) to accomplish the following:
* Compare two versions of my code to figure out the discrepancy in the newer version.
* Implement bequests with calibration of values using literature
* Revise the structural estimation procedure so that the bequest parameter is estimated as well
* Implement heterogeneity in risky returns (instead of heterogeneity in a risky asset)

For my job market paper, I accomplished the following:
* I would say that I made progress on the first two. There are a few days left this month so there is still time. The four goals are ambitious, as they would complete my work on this chapter on my dissertation (outside of robustness checks, etc). However, it may be possible that I complete the first three tasks by the beginning of summer. All four tasks may be complete by the beginning of fall.  I am curious to see how this evolves until then. 


Supposing there are discrepancies between a and b, explain why.

For my job market paper, I plan to accomplish the following next month:
* Implement bequests with calibration of values using literature
* Revise the structural estimation procedure so that the bequest parameter is estimated as well
* Implement heterogeneity in risky returns (instead of heterogeneity in a risky asset)
    note: I left out the first task since I will be done comparing the code by the end of this week.


4. What other papers are you working on? With whom?

* I am currently reading and trying to come up with a topic to co-author with a classmate, Kyung. I also have some budding ideas on the other two chapters of my dissertation, but for now, the tasks listed above are of higher priority. 

5. For each paper listed in 4, please answer the questions in 3?
